# ShoppyGlobe E-commerce Backend - Node.js & Express.js API

# Project Overview
This project provides the backend API for ShoppyGlobe, an e-commerce application. It is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, with key functionalities such as product management, shopping cart operations, user authentication, and more. The API is designed to handle e-commerce operations like fetching product lists, managing cart items, and securing routes with JWT-based authentication.


# Features

### 1. Product Management
- **Fetch All Products**: Retrieve a list of all available products in the database.
- **Fetch Product by ID**: Retrieve detailed information about a specific product by its ID.
- **Create a New Product**: Add a product to the database by providing image, name, price, description, and stock quantity.
- **Update an Existing Product**: Modify product details using its ID.
- **Delete a Product**: Remove a specific product from the database by ID.

### 2. Cart Management
- **Add Product to Cart**: Add a product to the shopping cart by specifying its ID and quantity.
- **Update Product Quantity in Cart**: Modify the quantity of a product in the cart using its ID.
- **Remove Product from Cart**: Remove a product from the cart by its ID.
- **Retrieve Userâ€™s Cart**: Fetch the list of products currently in a user's cart.

### 3. User Authentication
- **User Registration**: Register new users with a username, email, and password.
- **User Login**: Authenticate users and issue a JWT token for secure access to protected routes.
- **Protected Cart Routes**: Ensure only logged-in users with a valid JWT token can access cart management routes.

### 4. MongoDB Integration
- **Products Collection**:
  - Store product details, including name, price, description, and stock quantity.
  - Perform CRUD operations on the `products` collection.
- **Cart Collection**:
  - Store cart items, including product IDs and quantities linked to a user.
  - Perform CRUD operations on the `cart` collection.

### 5. API Error Handling & Validation
- **Input Validation**:
  - Validate product IDs before adding them to the cart.
  - Ensure all required fields are provided for user registration and login.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Return appropriate error messages for invalid requests.

### 6. API Testing
- All routes are tested using **ThunderClient & Postman** to ensure correct functionality.
- Screenshots of test results for each route are included in the `screenshots` folder.
